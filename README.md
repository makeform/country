# @makeform/country

Dropdown Country Picker


## Configs

none.


## Performance Consideration

Country list is long, thus it may take time to render. `@makeform/choice` now separate options rendering from other parts to improve performance, however this is just a workaround. form should be rendered when necessary, thus we should consider refactor how forms are rendered.
